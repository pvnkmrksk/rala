# Rala (ರಲ) - English to Kannada Reverse Dictionary

**Live Site**: [https://pvnkmrksk.github.io/rala/](https://pvnkmrksk.github.io/rala/)

Rala is an uneducated reverse dictionary that helps you find Kannada words by searching for their English meanings or definitions. Instead of looking up a Kannada word to find its meaning, you can search for an English concept and discover the corresponding Kannada words.

## Features

- **Direct Matches**: Find Kannada words that directly contain your search term in their definitions
- **Indirect/Synonym Matches**: Discover related Kannada words through synonyms and similar meanings
- **Automatic Sequential Search**: Direct matches load first, followed by indirect matches
- **Tabbed Interface**: Easy navigation between direct and indirect results
- **Real-time Search**: Instant results as you type

## How It Works

1. Enter an English word or phrase in the search box
2. Direct matches appear first in the "DIRECT MATCHES" tab
3. Indirect matches (via synonyms) load automatically and appear in the "Synonym/Indirect Matches" tab
4. Click on either tab to view the respective results
